## Configuration

You can always manage your project configuration using the file `wmtk/config.py`.

The content of `config.py` file should follow the format below:

```
# GOOGLE
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_URL = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?'
GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'your_google_custom_search_engine_api_key'
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = 'your_google_search_engine_id'
```

- `Remember:` This should be done before you get started with the project or it may not work as expected.
